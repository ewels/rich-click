# Changelog

## Version 1.8.0dev (2023-04-09)

- Add `--rich-config` option to the `rich-click` CLI.
- Lazy load Rich to reduce overhead when not rendering help text. [[#154](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/154)]
- Some internal refactors. These refactors are aimed at making the abstractions more maintainable over time, more consistent, and more adept for advanced used cases.
    - `rich_click.py` is exclusively the global config; all formatting has been moved to `rich_help_rendering.py`.
    - `RichCommand` now makes use of methods in the super class: `format_usage`, `format_help_text`, `format_options`, and `format_epilog`.
    - Global `formatter` object has been removed from the code.
    - `highlighter` is now constructed by the `RichHelpFormatter` rather than being inside the config object.
- Added `RichHelpConfiguration.load_from_globals()` classmethod, which pulls all configuration from `rich_click.py`.
- Fix bug with regex highlighter for options and switches.
- `RichHelpConfiguration()` is now asserted to be JSON serializable, as an option for porting configurations. That said, serialization is not a fully supported feature of the high-level API, so serialize the config at your own risk.
    - Related: `highlighter` is now deprecated in `RichHelpConfiguration`; please use `highlighter_patterns` instead.
- Moved exclusively to `pyproject.toml` and removed `setup.py` / `setup.cfg`; thank you [@Stealthii](https://github.com/Stealthii)!
- Moved to `text_markup: Literal["markdown", "rich", None]` instead of booleans.
- Fixed issue where error messages would not print to `stderr` by default.
- New configuration options: [[#178](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/178)]
    - `STYLE_OPTIONS_PANEL_BOX`
    - `STYLE_COMMANDS_PANEL_BOX`
    - `STYLE_ERRORS_PANEL_BOX`
- Many quality of life improvements for command and option groups:
    - Support both `command_path` and `command.name`.
    - Added wildcard (`*`) option for command groups and option groups, with thanks to [@ITProKyle](https://github.com/ITProKyle)!
    - Resolve duplicates.
    - Better typing for option groups and command groups with `TypedDict` [[#156](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/156)]
    - Added `panel_styles` support to groups. [[#178](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/178)]
    - Allow `table_styles` and `panel_styles` to be defined for the positional arguments group.

## Version 1.7.0 (2023-10-11)

> [!WARNING]
>
> Click 7.x support is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
> Please update to a newer version of click.

This release comes after merging a huge pull-request from [@BrutalSimplicity](https://github.com/BrutalSimplicity) - see [#92](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/92)

- Extends Click's `HelpFormatter` class
- Creates a `HelpConfiguration` class that doubles the current module-level settings
- Added a decorator that allows the `HelpConfiguration` to be passed into Click via the supported `context_settings` argument provided by the `Command` and `Group` classes.
- The Rich Console object can also be configured per command and is distinct from the Console instance used internally by the formatter. The `RichHelpFormatter` creates a console based on the `RichHelpConfiguration` as the tight coupling between the Formatter and Click's internals make it difficult to allow the Console to be configured externally (i.e. one example is that Click expects help formatting to be buffered).
- Created a `RichContext` class to allow creation of the custom formatter.
- The Rich Command, Group, and Context now expose the `Console` and `RichHelpConfiguration` properties.
- Added contributor VSCode settings

This PR closes a number of issues:

- [#25](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/25): Add tests!
- [#90](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/90): `click.ClickException` should output to `stderr`
- [#88](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/88): Rich Click breaks contract of Click's `format_help` and its callers
- [#18](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/18): Options inherited from context settings aren't applied

In addition, we merged another large pull-request that adds **full static type-checking support** (see issue [#85](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/85)), and fixes many bugs - see PR [#126](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/126).

In addition:

- Add new style option `STYLE_COMMAND` [[#102](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/102)]
- Add new style option `WIDTH` (in addition to `MAX_WIDTH`), thanks to [@ealap](httpsd://github.com/ealap) [[#110](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/110)]
- Add new style option `STYLE_ERRORS_SUGGESTION_COMMAND` [[#136](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/136)]
- Updated styling for `Usage:` line to avoid off-target effects [[#108](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/108)]
- Click 7.x support has been deprecated. [[#117](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/pull/117)]
- Fixed error where `ctx.exit(exit_code)` would not show nonzero exit codes.[[#114](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click/issues/114)]
